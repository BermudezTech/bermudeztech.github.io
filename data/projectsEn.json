All the information related to the shows come from the TVMaze API and also you can add some comments to each show. This comments are stored in a personal database and get loaded to the page using a custom API made with PHP. All of this is possible thanks to the asynchronous property of JS (AJAX and Fetch API) and by a custom hook in React (useFetch).</p><h2>Learned skills</h2><ul><li>Main working of the framework</li><li>Class components and functional components</li><li>Hooks (useState, useEffect and custom hooks)</li><li>SASS with React JS</li><li>CSS Animations</li><li>Advanced skills of JS (operators, arrow functions, destructuring, ...)</li><li>Making of a API with PHP and CORS policy</li><li>Pass data and events through components</li><li>Deploy of React app to Github pages</li></ul>",
