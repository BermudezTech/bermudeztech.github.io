        "description": "<p>This project contains a React JS user interface making use of the TVMaze rest API. This project was developed through my learning process of React JS and it's my first usable app with this JavaScript framework. You can search for shows stored in the TVMaze API.</p><h2>How it works?</h2><p>You just have to look for a show which is available in TVMaze, then you select by clicking the show you want to know more about. All the information related to the shows come from the TVMaze API and also you can add some comments to each show. This comments are stored in a personal database and get loaded to the page using a custom API made with PHP. All of this is possible thanks to the asynchronous property of JS (AJAX and Fetch API) and by a custom hook in React (useFetch).</p><h2>Learned skills</h2><ul><li>Main working of the framework</li><li>Class components and functional components</li><li>Hooks (useState, useEffect and custom hooks)</li><li>SASS with React JS</li><li>CSS Animations</li><li>Advanced skills of JS (operators, arrow functions, destructuring, ...)</li><li>Making of a API with PHP and CORS policy</li><li>Pass data and events through components</li><li>Deploy of React app to Github pages</li></ul>",
